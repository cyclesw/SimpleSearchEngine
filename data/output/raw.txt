Each node      of the tree stores its own value, plus an ordered list of its subnodes and      their keys. The tree allows easy access to any of its nodes by means of a path,      which is a concatenation of multiple keys.In addition, the library provides parsers and generators for a number of data      formats that can be represented by such a tree, including XML, INI, and JSON.Property trees are versatile data structures, but are particularly suited for      holding configuration data. The tree provides its own, tree-specific interface,      and each node is also an STL-compatible Sequence for its child nodes.Conceptually, then, a node can be thought of as the following structure:structptree{data_typedata;// data associated with the nodelist<pair<key_type,ptree>>children;// ordered list of named children};Both key_type and data_type are configurable to some extent, but will usually      be std::string or std::wstring, and the parsers only work with this kind of      tree.Many software projects develop a similar tool at some point of their lifetime,      and property tree originated the same way. We hope the library can save many      from reinventing the wheel.https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/doc/html/property_tree.html

TheBoost.CRClibrary      provides access to two styles of CRC computation, one as a function template,      the other as a function template and two computation object class templates,      where the two class templates differ in speed.https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/doc/html/crc.html

It provides classes and      functions for managing the threads themselves, along with others for synchronizing      data between the threads or providing separate copies of data specific to individual      threads.TheBoost.Threadlibrary was originally written      and designed by William E. Kempf (version 1).Anthony Williams version (version 2) was a major rewrite designed to closely      follow the proposals presented to the C++ Standards Committee, in particularN2497,N2320,N2184,N2139,      andN2094Vicente J. Botet Escriba started (version 3) the adaptation to comply with      the accepted Thread C++11 library (Make use of Boost.Chrono and Boost.Move)      and theShared      LockingHoward Hinnant proposal except for the upward conversions.      Some minor non-standard features have been added also as thread attributes,      reverse_lock, shared_lock_guard.In order to use the classes and functions described here, you can either include      the specific headers specified by the descriptions of each class or function,      or include the master thread library header:#include<boost/thread.hpp>which includes all the other headers in turn.https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_85_0/doc/html/thread.html
